### Step 1: Install Python
1. Download the Python installer for Windows from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).
2. Run the installer.
3. Make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" at the bottom of the installation window.
4. Click "Install Now" to proceed with the installation.

### Step 2: Verify Python Installation
1. Open Command Prompt and run:
    ```cmd
    python --version
    ```
2. This should display the installed Python version, confirming that Python was installed successfully.

### Step 3: Install pip (If Not Installed)
Usually, `pip` is installed with Python. To check if it's installed, run:
```cmd
pip --version
```
If it's not installed, download [get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) and run:
```cmd
python get-pip.py
```

### Step 4: Install Virtualenv
1. Open Command Prompt and run:
    ```cmd
    pip install virtualenv
    ```

### Step 5: Create a Virtual Environment
1. Navigate to your project directory.
2. Run the following command to create a virtual environment named `myenv` (you can choose a different name):
    ```cmd
    virtualenv myenv
    ```

### Step 6: Activate the Virtual Environment
1. To activate the virtual environment, run:
    ```cmd
    .\myenv\Scripts\activate
    ```
2. Your shell prompt will change to show the name of the activated environment.

### Step 7: Deactivate the Virtual Environment
1. To deactivate the virtual environment and revert to the global Python version, run:
    ```cmd
    deactivate
    ```

### Step 8: Install Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
1. Download and install VSCode from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Open VSCode and go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window.
3. Search for "Python" and install the extension provided by Microsoft.

### Step 9: Configure Python Interpreter in VSCode
1. Open your project folder in VSCode.
2. Click on the "Python" text in the lower-left corner of the window or use `Ctrl+Shift+P` and type "Python: Select Interpreter."
3. Choose the virtual environment you created earlier. It should be listed there.

### Step 10: Run Python Code in VSCode
1. Create a new Python file in your project folder.
2. Write some Python code.
3. Right-click anywhere in the editor window and select "Run Python File in Terminal."

And that's it! You've successfully installed Python, set up a virtual environment, and integrated everything with VSCode on your Windows machine. You can now start developing Python applications in an isolated environment, which is especially useful for managing dependencies in complex projects.
