This script is a Python program that defines a class `Interact_Buoy` which inherits from a class named `Sub`. The `Interact_Buoy` class is designed to interact with a buoy in a specific manner, targeting a face named "draugr" on the buoy. The buoy has three faces: draugr, aswang, and vetalas, and rotates at a speed of 1-5 RPM.

Here are the main components of the script:

1. **Imports**: The script imports necessary modules including `rospy`, `math`, and `Enum`, along with other modules from the StateMachine package.
    
2. **Class Definitions**:
    
    - **BuoyFaces**: An enumeration representing the different faces of the buoy: draugr, aswang, and vetalas.
    - **BuoyRotationOrder**: An enumeration representing the possible rotation orders of the buoy: DAV (draugr, aswang, vetalas) and VAD (vetalas, aswang, draugr).
3. **Interact_Buoy Class**:
    
    - ****init****: Initializes the state machine with outcomes and sets initial values for rotation order and target face.
    - **execute**: The main method that attempts to bump into the draugr face of the buoy. It calculates the rotation speed of the buoy and moves towards it at the right time.
    - **findBox & findFace**: Methods to find the index of the buoy face in a list and to find the currently visible face of the buoy.
    - **determineRotationSpeed**: Calculates the rotation speed of the buoy in RPM based on the time taken to switch from one face to another.
    - **buoyIsLost**: Checks if the buoy is lost by waiting for up to 30 seconds to see if any of the faces on the buoy are found.
    - **nextFace**: Returns the next face in the rotation order based on the current face.
    - **getThirdAtTime**: Determines what face will be showing at a certain time based on the period and start time.
