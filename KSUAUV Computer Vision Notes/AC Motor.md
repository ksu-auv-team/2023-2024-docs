AC Motors are motors that use [[Alternating Current]] to produce mechanical force. They are basically reversed [[Alternators]], in that electrical power is used to drive a mechanical force, rather than a mechanical force driving power generation.

Most AC motors work via induction, in which a central conductive (thereby movable by magnetism) "rotor" is spun by radial series of [[coils]] inside the "stator." Each coil inside the stator is connected in sequence to different phases of the [[Three Phase Power]], meaning they activate in sequence to another. As the three signals oscillate, each coil magnetizes to the stator in sequence, causing it to turn. The stator only turns due to it's unique segments-of-slants-shape, meaning each segment is in contact with differing magnets.
