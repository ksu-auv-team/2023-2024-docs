A [[Computer Vision|Machine Vision]] solution utilizing a [[Neural Network#Convolution Neural Network|convolution neural network]] model combined with [[OpenCV]].

YOLO has many different models, based on two categories
- Size of the model in parameters considered, ranging from nano to extra-large. The larger the model, the more overall accuracy it has.
- The task the model is designed for; classification, detection, segmentation, and posing.
